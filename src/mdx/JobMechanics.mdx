## Job Mechanics

### Aetherflow ![Aetherflow](//images.ctfassets.net/dsj52p3ork7k/xkOHWjLTXwkQAoEeiGiGo/2532033d52a17b81628810603852dd7a/aetherflow.png)
Using Aetherflow restores 10% of your MP and grants you three stacks of Aetherflow. Certain Actions will require and consume one stack. Consuming a stack reduces the cooldown of Aetherflow by five seconds. Make sure to use up your stacks in time to shorten the cooldown as much as possible.

Stacks granted by Dissipation will also lower the cooldown of Aetherflow by five seconds each.

### Faerie Gauge ![Faerie Gauge](//images.ctfassets.net/dsj52p3ork7k/6cv6V1qEQ8QMI4AMkcgMKA/b3c3efe299fdb17c2f9df35f837d454c/faeriegauge.png)

Consuming a single stack during combat increases your Faerie Gauge by 10. Gauge is used for Fey Union, which tethers your pet to your target and applies a powerful single-target regen while active. Your pet will not be able to move or perform any actions while Fey Union is active. Fey Union requires at least 10 gauge to activate. Fey Union consumes 10 gauge every tick (3 seconds). Fey Union will end if any of the following situation occur:

1. Your gauge reaches zero.
2. Your Fey Union'd target moves out of range (15 yalms). If this happens, your pet will stop all actions and your gauge will stop draining. If the targetted player moves back into range, the tether wil reapper and Fey union will resume.
3. You order your pet to use a cooldown, like Whispering Dawn. Generic pet commands such as Place, Heel, Sic etc. and Embrace will not work.
4. Your pet dies, you die, or you use Dissipate.

Your gauge will reset to zero if you die. However it will not reset if your pet dies or is dissipated.

Aetherpact is the action performed by the Scholar on a party member, which commands your pet to use Fey Union on that player. Aetherpact has a range of 30 yalms, which means that your target must be within 30 yalms of the Scholar, not your fairy. Fey Union has a range of 15 yalms, which refers to the length of the tether. If the target is more than 15 yalms away from the pet when Aetherpact is used, your fairy will move towards the target until it is within range and then proceed to use Fey Union.
